    "Now, we have been instructed to ignore the $\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{V} \\times \\mathbf{B})$ term, and the other terms. Thus the equation becomes:\n",

    "This differential equation turns out to be an elliptic partial differential equation, and solving it is well explored in literature. We will use the crank-nicolson method (popularly used to solve heat equations) to solve this equation. The crank-nicolson method is a finite difference method, and it is **unconditionally stable**. Although that doesn't mean that it is accurate, it is a good starting point for solving partial differential equations."
